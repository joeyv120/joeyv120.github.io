# Yet Another Hexcrawl Procedure
- Converted from [Yet Another Hexcrawl Procedure](https://dangerisreal.blogspot.com/2021/08/yet-another-hexcrawl-procedure-there-is.html), with permission.
- Based on [Wilderness Adventuring](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Wilderness_Adventuring) for [Old School Essentials](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/272802/OldSchool-Essentials-Basic-Rules).
- These procedures assume the classic 1 HEX = 6 miles = +/- 10 km but it works with any size. An unencumbered and healthy person can walk approximately 24 miles (or 40km) per day, equal to crossing 4 hexes.
- At the start of each day, roll for **Weather** on your favorite table. Example [here](https://ynasmidgard.blogspot.com/2019/02/simple-seasonal-weather-table.html) or [here](https://donjon.bin.sh/d20/weather/).

## Watches
The day is divided into 3 watches of _roughly 8 hours_ each:
- **Early watch** (+/- 6 am -> 2 pm)
- **Late watch** (+/- 2 pm -> 10 pm)
- **Night watch** (+/- 10 pm -> 6pm)

### For each watch, the party takes one action:

### Travel
The party travels through a hex.
- Progress up to half their daily travel distance (by foot, horse, cart, etc).
- Obvious locations, features, and terrain types of any neighboring hexes are revealed accordingly based on distance and sight.
- The party must be careful to avoid [Losing Direction](/hacks/third-party/hexcrawl-procedures/#losing-direction).
- Roll on the [Events Table](/hacks/third-party/hexcrawl-procedures/#events-table).

#### Losing Direction
- There is a 2-in-6 chance the party will get lost when traveling via difficult or hard-to-see terrain.
- Maps and relevant backgrounds negate the need for a roll, or decrease the chances to 1-in-6.

### Explore
The party searches for hidden any features within the current hex.
- Roll on the [Events Table](/hacks/third-party/hexcrawl-procedures/#events-table).
- One Location/Feature is discovered.

### Supply
The party gathers food and water.
- Roll on the [Events Table](/hacks/third-party/hexcrawl-procedures/#events-table).
- Hunting and foraging (if possible given the terrain).

### Camp
#### The party stops to set up camp.
- Roll on the [Events Table](/hacks/third-party/hexcrawl-procedures/#events-table).
- If _quiet_ or the party is able to rest fully, party members lose all their Fatigue (if applicable).

### Interact
#### The party interacts with a location/feature
- Dungeon delving, town/village adventure, lair exploration, long NPC interaction, etc...
- If the party is able to rest fully, party members lose all their Fatigue (if applicable).

### Fatigue
For each night the party skips _making camp_ or is _forced to march_, each PC gets one Fatigue.
