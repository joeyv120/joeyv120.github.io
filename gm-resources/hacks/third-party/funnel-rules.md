# Funnel Rules

- This text provides the necessary rules for creating PCs for a [funnel](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/51227/what-is-a-funnel) adventure. You can also find this in a one page PDF format [here](https://xenio-in-a-bottle.itch.io/funnel-for-cairn).

A **funnel** is a pre-campaign game mode where each player takes control of multiple characters that are still fresh and inexperienced, considerably less capable than the regular adventurers.

### Character  Creation

Each player creates 3 characters according to the following steps:

- Generate the Ability Scores of each character by rolling **3d6** and keeping **the two lowest results** for each ability in order (for a total of 2-12 in each ability score). Different from the core rules of Cairn, **no results are swapped**.

- Roll 1d4 to determine each character's starting Hit Protection (HP).

- Roll for the **Name, Background** and **Traits** in the tables found in pages **5** and **6** of Cairn.

- Each of the characters start with **A torch** (one slot), **One day rations**, 1d6 gold pieces and **two items from their background** according to the following table:

**After the funnel** any surviving characters become full adventurers. Advance them as:

-   For each ability, roll 1d6 and add the result to the ability score.

-   Roll 1d6, if the result is higher than your HP, it becomes the new total.

If a player has more than one surviving character, they can choose which one to keep after the advancement rolls.
