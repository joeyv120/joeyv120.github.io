# Classic Classes

- Based on the original [hack](https://dangerisreal.itch.io/classic-classes-for-cairn) by [Danger_is_Real](https://dangerisreal.blogspot.com/)

## Fighter
You are the Mercenary, the Barbarian, the Gladiator, The Knight.  
You are the master of the arts of combat and warfare

**Mercenary**: You have a contact you can turn to in almost every city. They aren't always happy to see you, though. Men blindly follow you in battle (they always pass **morale saves**).

**Barbarian**: Your place is in the wilderness, you despise civilization and fear magic. You drink blood like ale, regain 1d3 HP when you kill or CD an enemy. Your battle rage is so strong that you can harm creatures immune to mundane damage.

**Gladiator**: Your favorite weapon is an extension of you (your attacks are _enhanced_). You are a trained merciless killer. Your reputation is not always serving you and your former master is probably looking for you.

**Knight**: Your rank gives you credibility with the nobles. The peasantry will generally follow you into dangerous situations without the slightest hesitation. However if you fail them somehow, they may strip you of your rank. You are also a skilled horseman, your mounted attacks are _enhanced_.

**Character creation**

- Start with 1d4+2 **HP**.

**Paladin**: As a sacred warrior of your faith you will be obeyed by zealots. Priests will favor you but if you step out of the line you will fall in disgrace.
